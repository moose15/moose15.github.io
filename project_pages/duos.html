                 DuOS is a 2D puzzle platformer that takes place in a computer-esque world. It revolves around two robots, PLAT and MIA, as they navigate through a scrapyard, evade patrols, and escape the grips of destruction. Along their journey, they will encounter a number of interesting characters. However, are these characters friends or are they foes?
                 <br><br>
                 Players use a record and playback mechanic while switching between characters to solve puzzles. A simple example of play that would require this mechanic would be a timed switch only accessible to MIA and a locked door that PLAT must walk through. The player can record MIA hitting the switch and then change characters to PLAT to walk through the door during the playback of MIA's actions. This allows for various complex situations and puzzles.
                 <br><br>
                  This project began as a thesis project for Thomas Lu and Greg Chen, and I volunteered as a puzzle designer and usability researcher during its development. As the usability researcher on the team, I lead a Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation (RITE) test to help improve the usability of the project. During this test, data was collected from a total of fourteen playtests over a period of five weeks during the game's development.

                  As a puzzle designer, me and the rest of the design team strived to create a sense of flow as the player progressed through the levels. Juggling two characters can be challenging for some, and therefore we had to make sure each timer was appropriatly placed so that completing the puzzle was not deemed impossible. Not too hard, yet, not too easy. 
                  <br><br>
                  The player was responsible for figuring out their own strategy for completing puzzles and we saw a number of different methods during the RITE study. For example, a number of players liked to record a character hitting the timers multiple times to make sure they were triggered during playback even if they ran out of time. These players eventually completed the levels, though this method resulted in a longer playtest time then originally intended. Based on the results of the RITE study, the design team was able to iterate on the levels and create a better experience for the player.
